- Kixt Control Charset

...
This is a superset of the <https://charset.KIBI.network/Kixt/Transmission> character set which adds control characters for interfacing with applications, 32 noncharacters (which map to their Unicode equivalents), as well as some additional format characters.
Characters defined are in the ranges 00–20, 7F, and 80A0–80DF.
